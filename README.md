Hello, my name is Luiz André

I've always liked games since I was a kid, until I was interested in the area of game creation.

I've done a course in creating digital and other related games, I've learned a lot and I'm still developing into: 
C# Programming, 3D Modeling, 3D Animation, Sound Editing and Digital Illustration.

I intend to seek more and learn in other areas related to the creation of games, 
but I'm more of the area of Programming and 3D Modeling.
